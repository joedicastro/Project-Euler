## About Project Euler

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) is a website to challenge
mathematicians and programmers with mathematical problems intended to help
you to improve your mathematical and programming skills.

Extracted from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler):

> Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a
series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer
programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in
mathematics and computer programming. It includes over 400 problems, with a
new one added every weekend. Problems are of varying difficulty but each is
solvable in less than a minute using an efficient algorithm on a modestly
powered computer.

## About this repository

There is my attempt to solve some problems of this project, using the
python language. The target is to solve as many as I can, and keep the time
consumed by each script below 30 second at a minimum and preferably below
10s.

### Contents:

- directories from `$ ls -d [0-9][0-9][0-9]`: contains the python script(s)
  with the solution and the auxiliary files needed to solve them. Sometimes
  I have more than one solution to the same problem.
- `README.md`: this document
- `times.json`: the time taken to solve each script stored in json format
- `update.py`: an utility script to automatize some tasks:

  - Downloads an off-line copy of the Project Euler's website with all the
   problems in a single page.

  - Creates this document automatically, computing the solved problems to
   know the time consumed by each solution.

   - Creates a new dir locally for each problem (new problems also),
   downloads automatically all the necessary auxiliary files and create a
   new python file with the problem's formulation as the document string.

 This is an example of a created python file for this script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python2
# -*- coding: utf8 -*-

"""
Special Pythagorean triplet
Problem 9
http://projecteuler.net/problem=9

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for
which, a² + b² = c²

For example, 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5².

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

## About Cheating

Don't cheat! If you cheat, you only fool yourself! If you can't do it, you
can not do it, that's all! Almost you tried, and if you keep learning and
studying, maybe one day you can solve those problems that seemed so hard a
few early.

Be proud of what you have achieved instead, even if is little. Especially
if your math skills or education is not so vast (as in my case). I'm very
proud to have solved all of this problems without cheating or copy another
else's solutions. That's the right attitude.

But, once you have a solution, you can learn a lot from the solutions of
others. That's the purpose of the Project Euler's forum and it's fine.
That's the main purpose of this repository too. Maybe you couldn't learn a
lot from my solutions, maybe even you can laugh of the most naive ones, but
doesn't matter, be humble and remember that even the most idiot can teach
you always something. The second purpose is to have a online backup of this
code, some problems were hard to break and I would hate to loose this code.

__The most important thing isn't the Project Euler's rank that you achieve
or the number of problems that you solved, the most important thing is what
you have learned in the process!__
